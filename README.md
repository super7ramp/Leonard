Upset about being lost in a new building? Feeling the urge to reach a specific room but you do not want to get lost? It seems like you need the help of our guiding drone!

We are proud to introduce to you are newest product: **Findy**! **Findy** is a completely autonomous drone acting inside of buildings. Thanks to Bluetooth beacons deployed in all of the building, the drone is able to calculate his position and define paths to get to any equipped room or hallway!

Why would I choose Findy, you may ask? Maybe you do not understand how to read a map. And well, who bring a map when he goes to the mall? 

## Features

Here are the mains features of **Findy**:
* Autonomous flight: flight controls are designed with [SCADE SuiteÂ®](http://www.systerel.fr/).
* Guiding procedure: **Findy** is able to choose the shortest path to reach a specific destination. All you have to do is to tell him where you want to go.
* Drone location retrieving: you are able to get the drone position at any time (pc application).
* Remote control with Android application (not implemented yet, for now there is a small pc application)
* Definition of meeting point (not implemented yet)
